## My Implementation:

1- the location is brought in real time the first you start browsing the main page.

2- upper header buttons don't work for now.

3- the categories doesn't have icons because they are dynamically generated with the api call. TODO

4- add button at the bottom, useless.

5- i created settings page and about to make 4 tabs and center circle.

6- settings don't work because it need some time.

### Plugins:

I used this plugin in chrome to add to responses 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header, link below:

### TODOs:

1- getting to change the theme dynamically, maybe store the theme in localstorage.

2- make a list of countries to pick one to change app content

3- align promotion cards, need to override ionic classes styles

4- when pushing a page to navigate to ir, back button doesn't go back have to go back manually, look into that
